# Project Roadmap: Building a Full-Stack Video Streaming Platform

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the step-by-step guide to build a full-stack video streaming platform with microservices architecture, from setup to production deployment.

### Key Features
1. Voice capture sharing
2. Screen capture sharing (like Twitch & Discord)
3. WebRTC & WebSocket for real-time communication
4. Video upload support (like YouTube)
5. Live chat system
6. Multiple routes:
   - Login and authentication
   - Viewing streams of different users
   - Card-like UI (similar to Twitch/YouTube) that opens streams on click
7. Storing streams and videos in an S3 bucket

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Planning and Requirements
1. **Define Functional Requirements**
   - List all core and optional features for MVP.
   - Outline user stories (e.g., "As a user, I can upload a video" or "As a viewer, I can chat during live streams").

2. **Design System Architecture**
   - Microservices: Identify services (e.g., User Service, Stream Service, Chat Service, Media Processing Service).
   - Frontend: Use Next.js for UI and client-side logic.
   - Backend: Use Node.js for APIs, WebRTC signaling, and WebSocket servers.

3. **Choose Technologies**
   - **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
   - **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, WebSocket, WebRTC
   - **Database**: MongoDB for user and metadata; Redis for caching.
   - **Storage**: AWS S3 for videos and streams.
   - **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ or Kafka for inter-service communication.
   - **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines.

4. **Create an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)**
   - Map entities: Users, Videos, Streams, Chats, Comments, etc.
   - Define relationships (e.g., One-to-Many for Users to Videos).

5. **Wireframe the UI**
   - Design pages: Login, Dashboard, Video Player, Chat, and User Profile.
   - Use tools like Figma or Adobe XD.

---

### Phase 2: Environment Setup
1. **Set Up Frontend**
   - Initialize Next.js project.
   - Configure TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS.

2. **Set Up Backend**
   - Create separate repositories for each microservice (e.g., `auth-service`, `stream-service`, `chat-service`).
   - Initialize Node.js projects for each service.
   - Add necessary dependencies (e.g., Express.js, Mongoose).

3. **Set Up Databases**
   - Deploy MongoDB instance for user data and video metadata.
   - Deploy Redis instance for caching.

4. **Set Up Storage**
   - Configure AWS S3 bucket for video storage.
   - Implement policies for secure access (IAM roles, bucket policies).

5. **Integrate Docker**
   - Write Dockerfiles for frontend and backend services.
   - Use Docker Compose for local development.

### Phase 3: Core Feature Development

#### Step 1: Authentication and Authorization
- **Frontend**:
  - Create login and registration pages.
  - Use JWT for authentication.
  
- **Backend**:
  - Implement `auth-service` for user management (registration, login, password reset).
  - Integrate middleware for token validation.

#### Step 2: Video Upload & Storage
- **Frontend**:
  - Build a form to upload videos.
  - Use file upload progress indicators.

- **Backend**:
  - Implement `media-service` for file uploads.
  - Use AWS SDK to upload files to S3.
  - Generate and store metadata (e.g., file size, format).

#### Step 3: Streaming (WebRTC)
- **Frontend**:
  - Implement real-time voice/screen sharing using WebRTC APIs.
  - Add a video player for HLS streams.

- **Backend**:
  - Implement `stream-service` for WebRTC signaling (SDP exchange).
  - Use FFmpeg to transcode videos for HLS.

#### Step 4: Live Chat
- **Frontend**:
  - Build a real-time chat interface.

- **Backend**:
  - Implement `chat-service` using WebSocket for real-time updates.
  - Store messages in MongoDB.

---

### Phase 4: Additional Features
1. **Content Search and Recommendations**
   - Use MongoDB aggregation for filtering and sorting videos.
   - Implement a basic recommendation algorithm (e.g., "users who watched this also watched...").

2. **Likes/Dislikes and Comments**
   - Allow users to like/dislike videos and add comments.
   - Store data in MongoDB.

3. **Video History Tracking**
   - Track user viewing history.
   - Implement "Continue Watching" functionality.

4. **Card-Like UI**
   - Display videos in a grid layout.
   - Link each card to a detailed video/stream page.

---

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
1. **Unit and Integration Tests**
   - Write tests for backend APIs using tools like Mocha/Chai.
   - Test frontend components using Jest and React Testing Library.

2. **Load and Stress Testing**
   - Use tools like JMeter to test streaming performance.

3. **Optimize for Performance**
   - Use CDN (e.g., CloudFront) for serving video content.
   - Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data.

---

### Phase 6: Deployment
1. **Setup CI/CD Pipelines**
   - Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automating tests and deployments.

2. **Containerization and Orchestration**
   - Build Docker images for all services.
   - Deploy using Kubernetes.

3. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - Deploy frontend and backend on cloud services (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
   - Use AWS RDS for managed databases.

4. **Domain and SSL**
   - Register a domain and configure DNS.
   - Set up SSL using Let's Encrypt or AWS Certificate Manager.

---

### Phase 7: Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Monitoring**
   - Use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring metrics.
   - Set up logging with ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).

2. **Bug Fixes and Updates**
   - Collect user feedback.
   - Release updates incrementally.

---

### Phase 8: Scaling and Future Enhancements
1. **Scale Infrastructure**
   - Use auto-scaling groups for backend services.
   - Scale databases and S3 buckets as needed.

2. **Introduce AI/ML Features**
   - Add AI-based recommendations.
   - Implement content moderation using machine learning models.

3. **Mobile App**
   - Build a mobile app for iOS and Android.
   - Use React Native or Flutter for cross-platform development.
